Key Visual — “Cake Booking”

Reference Document for the Implementation Agency

⸻

1. Brand Essence

Luxury with a light and friendly feel. The look evokes an evening gala at an elegant bakery: a deep midnight navy contrasts with blush pinks and soft golden highlights. The eye is drawn first to the hero cake – perfectly lit, with floral details and subtle art-deco sparkles. The “Cake Booking” title in a classic serif font communicates prestige, while surrounding UI elements provide modern functionality.
